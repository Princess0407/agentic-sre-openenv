# 🚀 Agentic SRE OpenEnv: Production-Grade RL Environment for Incident Remediation

Welcome to the **Agentic SRE Environment**! This repository contains a fully containerized, stateful reinforcement learning environment built on the **[OpenEnv 0.1](https://github.com/huggingface/openenv)** specification. 

Historically, Reinforcement Learning researchers relied on simple game sandboxes (like OpenAI Gym/CartPole) which fail to evaluate modern tool-using LLM Agents. This project simulates a real-world **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) incident response** scenario — complete with a mocked microservice mesh, database locks, and latency spikes — forcing AI Agents to triage, diagnose, and remediate multi-stage outages just like a human engineer.

> [!TIP]
> **View this on Hugging Face Spaces!** 
> This environment is built to be deployed seamlessly with the Hugging Face Docker SDK, exposing a WebSocket (`/ws`) for continuous RL training via libraries like TRL or VeRL.

## 🏗️ Architectural Highlights

This environment was meticulously designed for determinism, stable RL gradients, and true multi-agent execution:

- **Type-Safe Pydantic Boundaries**: All Agent `Actions` (Diagnostic Queries, Log Inspections, Remediation) and `Observations` (Golden Signals, Stdout, Stderr) are strictly typed to prevent format hallucination.
- **Dual-RNG Determinism**: Fault injection is strictly seeded for reproducibility, while a secondary "Network Shim" injects reproducible latency jitter to prevent agents from merely memorizing paths.
- **Stateful FSM Orchestration**: A central Orchestrator dictates state transitions (`TRIAGE` → `INVESTIGATION` → `REMEDIATION` → `VERIFICATION`), preventing endless, unstructured internal looping.
- **Continuous Correction Pipeline (CI/CD/CM/CC)**: Automatically tracks the incident lifecycle. The mock infrastructure natively computes the Four Golden Signals and tracks error budget **Burn Rates**.
- **Layout-Aware Hierarchical RAG**: Utilizes `unstructured` and FAISS to parse SRE Runbook PDFs offline, retaining visual hierarchies that flat-text chunking destroys.
- **Dense Mathematical Reward Shaping**: Returns precise rewards between `[-0.5, 1.5]` using the blueprint formula: `R_t = α·ΔH_t + β·M_t + λ·E_t − γ·P_t − δ`, explicitly rewarding progress and penalizing destructive syntax.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies. The numerical backend aggressively pins `numpy < 2.0` and utilizes a CPU-only PyTorch wheel to keep the Docker image inherently lean.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Generate the Offline RAG Index
To ensure the Docker container starts immediately without network calls, the FAISS index must be built locally into the `assets/` folder first.

```bash
python rag/offline_index.py
```

### 3. Spin up the Environment Server
```bash
uvicorn server.app:app --port 8000
```

### 4. Run the Baseline Assessment
To test your agent against the environment, run the baseline script in a separate terminal. Note: you can provide an OpenAI/HuggingFace API token, or leave it blank to execute the deterministic 'Mock LLM' fallback!

```bash
python inference.py
```

## 🎯 Hackathon Judging Criteria Satisfied
* **Real-World Utility:** Directly simulates the `$M/hr` problem of corporate incident response.
* **OpenEnv Compliance:** Natively implements `openenv.yaml` schemas, strict episode bounding, and Websocket streaming.
* **Grader Quality:** Leverages non-linear exponential decay ($e^{-1.45 * t_m / T_{max}}$) for Mean-Time-To-Mitigation (MTTM) reward components.
* **Environment Design:** Protected from context-window bloat via rolling context summaries; isolated agent security using a dedicated `QuarantineAgent`.
